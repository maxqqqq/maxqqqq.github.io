# Finale: Monetizing your site
## If you have followed every single step in this series, you should have a grand site, just like this one.
## Today, the finale, we'll be learning about monetizing your site.
## **1. Offer donations**
## Just like mine [donate page](https://qqiumax.github.io/donate/), you could build your own donation pages with paypal, cryptocurrencies, and more. If you have a supportive traffic, it should earn you some money. 
## **2. Build a subscribe email list**
## Just like mine [subscribe page](https://qqiumax.github.io/subscribe/), you can build your email list to get more connection to your readers, but don't give *too much* ads or else you could lose your traffic.
## **3. Selling adspace on you site**
## This is hard, but should earn you a lot.
## **4. Getting money from consults**
## Just like my [support](https://qqiumax.github.io/help/) page, you could earn money from paid consults! It wouldn't be a lot, but definately an easy one.
## **5. Selling your site**
## Flip your site to exchange all your works for money, not recommanded, but should earn you a lot.
## **That is all for this series! Find out other series at the blue link below!!**
