# Part04 -- Initializing your first own git repository
## In the last few lessons, you are all prepared to get your hands on git, lets start!
## **Find a place for git**
## Create a folder where you would like to put all your git repositories.
## Open the folder and left click it and click "git bash".
## You are done!
## **Create a only-local repository(not recommended)**
## 1.Create another folder you would like to have your new repository
## 2.In git bash, use <code>git init</code>
## 3.If you see a hidden folder called ".git" you are done!

## If you only want it in your own computer and not on Github, use this method
## **Creating a only-remote repository(not recommended)**
## 1. Go to <https://www.github.com/>
## 2. In the upper-right-corner, click your profile picture
## 3. In the dropdown, select "your repositories"
## 4. Again in the upper-left corner, choose the green button "new" , add whatever you want to add, like .gitinore files, README.md files, and LICENSE files, we will talk about it in later classes
## 5. And you are done! You can do whatever you want to do in github!
## **Now, the recommended type comes**
## **Creating a both remote AND local repository**
## 1. Follow ALL the steps in "Create a only-local repository" section
## 2. Navigate to your repository, in the upper-left, green button called "code", in the dropdown, select SSH. Click the "copy" logo, and keep it.

## 3. In a folder you like you keep your git repositories, left click and open git bash,and type <code>git clone thing_you_just_copied_here</code>
## You will see a .git file and everything you have created in the github step!
## And you are all done! Get ready for the next class to work with git!
