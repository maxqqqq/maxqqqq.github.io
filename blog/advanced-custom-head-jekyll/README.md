# Part1: Custom Head snippets with Jekyll on  theme
## In the web basics, we learned to add UA properties of google analytics, but since it will end soon, we need to use GA4 properties. Also, we might want to use Microsoft clarity and Yandex metrica, but they all require to but a code in the head-/head section. What shall we do if we want to add those? Easy enough, all you need is a folder and a file!
## **Using the Includes folder**
## Checking the structure of the Cayman theme, which is I use, the best way is to create an <code>_includes</code> folder! You can create it manually on all operating systems.

## **Custom head file**
## After creating the _includes folder, enter the directory and add a file called head-custom.html.

## **Custom head snippets**
## Edit the custom-head.html with any editor you want, you can even edit it with notepad! Paste all the codes for Google Analytica and Clarity and Metrica etc. ! 
## Then, add, commit, and push to update the remote repository!
## **Now, open your website, and open the developer mode, or inspect, you should be able to see the customed head snippets!
