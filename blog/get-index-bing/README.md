# Part 07: Get indexed by bing
## Getting your site on the second-largest search engine is not easy. Although you might have your site even on Google, you somehow cannot get on bing. 
## Getting your hand on Bing is quite easy, first, open <https://www.bing/com/webmasters/> and following the directions, import it from Google search console we learned [last lesson](https://qqiumax.github.io/blog/making-your-site-on-engines/).Or you can upload a file too, but importing is easier and more managable.
## 2. Submit a sitemap, same as google.
## 3. Submit all your URLs in URL submission tool
## 4. Do a SEO scan in the SEO section, make sure no errors occur
## 5. Wait for it to get indexed!
## Be careful, since bing is more strict than google and does NOT process imformation as well. So many of your pages will not be indexed, Like me, I have got my whole site on google, but only the frontpage on bing, bad news!
## Next lesson will be the Finale for the series, get prepared!
