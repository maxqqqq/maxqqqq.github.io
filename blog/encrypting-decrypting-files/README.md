# Finale: Encrypting and Decrypting Files
## **Encrypting**
## 1. Import the reciptent's key, like [last class](https://qqiumax.github.io/blog/signing-files-and-verify/)
## 2. Open a command line interface, like terminal, bash, cmd etc. And change to the file's directory
## 3. Use <code>gpg --encrypt -r "Public_Key's_EMAIL_HERE" "FILE_NAME"</code>
## 4. The result will be a .gpg file, send the .gpg file to reciever, and you are done!
## **Decrypting**
## 1. Save the .gpg file you recieved to your locals
## 2. Open a command line tool, like terminal,bash,cmd, etc. and change to the file's directory
## 3. Use <code>gpg "file_name_with_.gpg"</code>
## 4. Open the newly created file, and read the secret message!
## This is the finale of the series, so this series will be ended. Next series we are going to learn Git throughtly!
