## This is very annoying and could affect the effectivity of your site, it also affects your SEO, or search engine performance!
## **Solution!!!**
## First go to <https://github.com/orgs/pages-themes/repositories> and click the respository with your theme name on it. Put the browser beside.
## Then, on your local repository, in the root directory, create a folder called <code>_layouts</code>.

## Now in you browser, using cayman as an example, click the _layouts as seen:

## Now enter the default.html file and enter a page like this:

## Now Copy the whole thing into your local repository and save.
## ** Important: Now delete any line with words like "Skip" or "generated" or "credits"**
## Save, commit and push to remote, and you are done! You can even use this to change footnotes if you can understand HTML!
