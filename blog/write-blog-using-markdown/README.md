# Part02: Using Markdown to write blogs
## A you have learned in the [last class](https://qqiumax.github.io/blog/get-your-github-domain/), you now have a wonderful domain for everyone to see your published content. Some people might be asking, Do we need to learn HTML? The answer is NO, you don't. Markdown is an amazing language that turns text to websites with amazingly easy syntax, and this is what we are going to learn

## Don't forget to open your README.md file in Github, and let us ride on!

## **Headers**
## Headers are made by hashtags(#) before a line, like <code># asdf</code> or <code>## abcd</code>. There are 6 sizes of headers: 1 hashtag for the largest, and 6 for the lowest, here is them listed in order:
# 1 Hashtag
## 2 Hashtags
### 3 Hashtags
#### 4 Hashtags
##### 5 Hashtags
###### 6 Hashtags
## Be used to these tags, they are the most important syntax of the markdown language

## **Bolds** *Italics*
## Two stars(*)at start and end: <code>**bold**</code> and 1 star at start and end for italics: <code>*italics*</code>

## [links](https://qqiumax.github.io/blog/write-blog-using-markdown/)
## For links, <code>[text you want to display](link with https://)</code> syntax to create link

## **Images**
## Same as link, but add a ! mark before the square bracket

## Codes
## for codes, use HTML 
    <code>asd</code>
    <code>print("asdf")</code>

## Now you have learned the basic of markdown, go and create your own blog with it in your README.md!
## After you have created your blog, commit the changes, and wait for a few minutes, now visit your domain and you now have your first published blog!

### Next class we will learn git, so first install git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)and keep clicking next, but remember to change the default branch to "main" not master, read the directions on each page carefully until the finish installing page. Left click anywhere and it look like this:
