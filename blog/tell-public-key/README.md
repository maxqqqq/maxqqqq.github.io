# Telling other about your public key
## As we know, it might be hard for people to not use mails and other government-controlled social medias to send others a public key. The key might get deleated or censored.
## So here we have our "keyserver", they are not government-censored and is used by all, examples are <http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/> or <https://keys.openpgp.org/>, this could be amazing to send all your keys through an uncensored way.
## you should export you public key in bash using 
<code> gpg --export -a -o public.key [KEYID] </code>
## And then you can copy or past the file to the servers, and now you are done!
