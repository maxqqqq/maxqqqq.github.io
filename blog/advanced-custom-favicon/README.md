## So this class we are going to learn how to customize your OWN icon.
## **Favicon origin and benefits**
## A favicon, is the compound of the words favorite and icon. It can help readers of your site remember your site more clearly and makes the site more interesting.
## **Generating an icon**
## To have an favicon, you need an .ico file. You can generate it anywhere, here I used the <https://favicon.io/> to generate my icon. You can turn text, pictures, or emojies into favicons. When downloading the icon, there might be a bunch of files, but all we need, is the favicon.ico file.
## **Putting up the icon**
## First, save the favicon.ico file in the root directory of your repository,
## Then, enter the _includes file, you may or may not need to create one.
## Next, enter the file of head-custom.html, you may or may not need to create it too!
## Last, in the first line of the file, add a line of code: 

    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon""href="https://your_github_username.github.io/favicon.ico">

## And push to the origin, and you are all done!
