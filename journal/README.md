## **3 Chinese conspiracies you have heard**
### I have heard many Chinese conspiracies(which are all totally fake) for example this few: 1. The Chinese president is trying to be an emperor and dictate the world. 2. Coca-Cola is a special medicine that controls human minds. 3. You can not take pictures of the Buddha and his belongings, or else you well have terrible luck. I have experiences on the third as I have seen a person taking pictures of the Buddha in a holy tower and got wallet stolen after she wallet got stolen and she lost everything.

## **Do you feel like sometimes you contradict yourself?**
### I feel a lot of times I contradicts myself as I feel I want to do one thing but also terribly want to do another totally opposite thing at the same time. I feel that I am going to rip apart. Usually, I let myself to be decided on fate, which almost every time I am biased and failed to give a answer and I have to choose the thing that helps me more.

## **Reflection: how can I motivate myself**
### to motivate myself I have to do a special procedure to cure all the hatred and laziness inside me. First, I drink some water, although this all seemed nonsense, but water is vital for clear thinking. Secondly, I ease all my muscles for a second my stretching out my body as far as I am. Finally, just get to work. Since my work have a lot of typing, I usually do not feel boring as I can write about every thoughts I have. Success is the mother of success .

## **Are we living in a dystopian world now?**
### I believe we are in a total dystopian society as we are having governments that are in-transparent and have greed and hideous people in high ranks, especially in eastern countries, as they have only one government party and they usually associate patriotism with “loving the government” they also tries to be “equal” but loses the fairness in competition.

## **Random thought**
### I am currently living in China, so I am having a vacation today. But because we are still in lockdown and in quarantine, I am not able to go anywhere, therefore, I believe there is not point of having a holiday since we have to work on weekends after the holiday to keep up the work.

## **Can you see any similarities between society today and the story Harrison Bergeron?**
### In modern society today, we have the government banning people with magnificent abilities from talking. In our society, even though the government does not ban people with high IQ or EQ, but they do ban people with more information access or know the “truth” I won’t say which country or countries it is, but there definitely is some countries like that.

## **Reflection: What have you learned about yourself in MBTI?**
### In this amazing lockdown, I have learned many about myself. For example, I had learned that I am not so smart and special, I tried not to review anything but do a few questions before the big math practice (which we don't say the T word you might think that has a similar meaning as an final exam. According to law, there should be no tests, so we don’t have tests, we have only "practice") And I come out to have a grade worse than a stupid stubborn donkey would have. I got really mad and started to pay more attention in class than ever and done homework using my best attitude. I got better at my homework grades and I learned one of my most important lesson of life: don't overlook studying.

## **Random thoughts**
### This night someone sent a weird link that has no previews in the chat. I didn't even think or look what are others' reflection, I just click on it and thought my mate build some surprising thing. When I entered, they said I have to accept cookies, which I clicked on "decline" BIG MISTAKE there comes a scary picture that you can ever think of. The music was shrieking loud and I literally jumped out of my seat, telling my dad to close the webpage. I cried out of fright, even though I didn't have nightmares, I am still super-duper scared of any links people send to me.

## **Random thoughts**
### I had an grammar "practice" today an I got 44.5/55. Which if I change to out of 100, I would get only about 83 points, and is a pretty low score for such a easy test. The average for the class is 50/53, which I have 5.5 points of gap between, I Really NEED to pay more attention in class.

### **Random thoughts**
### Today I had tried to put Google Analytics in my site, but failed due to the website is written in markdown. I had deleted every single file and thing I wrote, except for the Journal section. I wrote everything in HTML again but failed because Jekyll wasn’t installed and Github does not support HTML Jekyll. I had to build **EVERYTHING**  from Scratch. I was exhausted after all.

## **What have you found out about your personality in MBTI?**
### I found I am a ENTJ-T and I found I am a amazing commander. I do like to gather around people and lead in groups, I am more of rational than emotional person, and I am really impressed! I feel that MBTI is quite accurate!

## **Random Thought**
### Today I skinned my body pretty bad.I really hate it. The thing was like this: Because the quarentine was cancelled and we do not have to be locked up in our complex today, thus I was so happy, I rode my bike so fast that I wobbled. The bike has many brakes, and in order to pass a tunnel, I need to lower my brakes.But since I was riding so fast, and I was standing on my bike, thus the chain of the bike stuck, and I fell to the ground, I slid, with my left shoulder in the center, I turned 180 degrees, and I blacked out, ut only for a second. I was immobile at the second, my elbows were bloody, and it was painful.

## **Random thought**
### I think I am rotting these days. Either I had rotten luck, or my attitude to life and study was rotten. I almost failed my math, **the third time in a row!** I was rotting. I hate it. You could say I have not participated in class, but every student in my class knows I am almost *too* active in class. How come?

## **Reflection: Your choice**
